## ansible-enV2
A small yet modular, scalable and reusable environment/template for learning Ansible.

### What happened to the original Ansible environment?
It was pretty terrible.

### What made the original Ansible environment so "terrible"?
It didn't make any sense, there were just a couple of files hanging around. There was no
no file structure at all. It wasn't even making use of Ansible's modularity and reusability in mind.

### Is there any other reason why this repository was created?
Apart from learning Ansible, I want to be as prepared as possible (have a lot of roles tasks and playbooks) before my SysAdmin internship starts. So I can be a bit more efficient.

### Do I expect contributions to this project?
I don't expect any contributions. Although it would be great if someone comes up with interesting ideas/tasks/playbooks so everyone can benefit from it.
